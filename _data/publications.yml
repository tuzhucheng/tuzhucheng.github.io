  title: An Experimental Analysis of the Power Consumption of Convolutional Neural Networks for Keyword Spotting
  link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00333
  abstract: "Nearly all previous work on small-footprint keyword spotting with
  neural networks quantify model footprint in terms of the number of
  parameters and multiply operations for a feedforward inference pass. These values
  are, however, proxy measures since empirical performance in actual
  deployments is determined by many factors. In this paper, we study the
  power consumption of a family of convolutional neural networks for
  keyword spotting on a Raspberry Pi. We find that both proxies are good
  predictors of energy usage, although the number of multiplies is more
  predictive than the number of model parameters. We also confirm that models
  with the highest accuracies are, unsurprisingly, the most power hungry."

  title: An Exploration of Approaches to Integrating Neural Reranking Models in Multi-Stage Ranking Architectures
  link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08275
  abstract: "We explore different approaches to integrating a simple convolutional
  neural network (CNN) with the Lucene search engine in a multi-stage
  ranking architecture. Our models are trained using the PyTorch deep
  learning toolkit, which is implemented in C/C++ with a Python
  frontend. One obvious integration strategy is to expose the neural network
  directly as a service. For this, we use Apache Thrift, a software
  framework for building scalable cross-language services.
  In exploring alternative architectures,
  we observe that once trained, the feedforward evaluation of neural
  networks is quite straightforward. Therefore, we can extract the parameters of
  a trained CNN from PyTorch and import the model into Java, taking
  advantage of the Java Deeplearning4J library for feedforward evaluation.
  This has the advantage that the entire end-to-end system can be implemented in Java. As a
  third approach, we can extract the neural network from PyTorch and
  \"compile\" it into a C++ program that exposes a Thrift service.
  We evaluate these alternatives in terms of performance (latency and throughput) as well
  as ease of integration.
  Experiments show that feedforward evaluation of the convolutional
  neural network is significantly slower in Java, while the performance of
  the compiled C++ network does not consistently beat the PyTorch implementation."

  title: Exploring the Effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks for Answer Selection in End-to-End Question Answering
  link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07804
  abstract: "Most work on natural language question answering today focuses on
  answer selection: given a candidate list of sentences, determine
  which contains the answer. Although important, answer selection is
  only one stage in a standard end-to-end question answering
  pipeline. This paper explores the effectiveness of convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) for answer selection in an end-to-end context using
  the standard TrecQA dataset.
  We observe that a simple <i>idf</i>-weighted word overlap
  algorithm forms a very strong baseline, and that despite substantial
  efforts by the community in applying deep learning to tackle answer selection,
  the gains are modest at best on this dataset.
  Furthermore, it is unclear if a CNN is more effective than the baseline
  in an end-to-end context based on
  standard retrieval metrics. To further explore this finding, we conducted
  a manual user evaluation, which confirms that
  answers from the CNN are detectably better than those from <i>idf</i>-weighted
  word overlap. This result suggests that users are sensitive to relatively small
  differences in answer selection quality."

  title: "Prizm: A Wireless Access Point for Proxy-Based Web Lifelogging"
  link: https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N25521
  abstract: "We present Prizm, a prototype lifelogging device that comprehensively
  records a user’s web activity. Prizm is a wireless
  access point deployed on a Raspberry Pi that is designed
  to be a substitute for the user’s normal wireless access point.
  Prizm proxies all HTTP(S) requests from devices connected
  to it and records all activity it observes. Although this particular
  design is not entirely novel, there are a few features
  that are unique to our approach, most notably the physical
  deployment as a wireless access point. Such a package allows
  capture of activity from multiple devices, integration
  with web archiving for preservation, and support for offline
  operation. This paper describes the design of Prizm, the
  current status of our project, and future plans."
