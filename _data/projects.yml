- name: Knowledge Extraction and Visualization
  technologies: Scala, JavaScript
  link: "https://github.com/crea-berkeley/relation-extraction"
  description: "I worked within a team consisting of students from the University of Waterloo
                and Professor S. Garan from the University of California, Berkeley, on NLP
                relation extraction and visualization. I was responsible for building a
                data pipeline to allow the relation extraction program to processing abstracts from PubMed.
                 I also worked on parsing a human anatomy tree, a web app that can visualize
                 binary relations, and a tool to curate extracted relations.
                 Technologies I work with include Scala, Docker, Sigma.js, D3.js, React, MySQL, and PostgreSQL."

- name: Sleep Guardian
  technologies: Python, Android, JavaScript

  description: Combine browser history with mobile app usage events to calculate how much you sleep each night,
               eliminating the need for any user data entry under the assumption you use your phone, tablet, or
               computer before and after sleeping. This idea was envisioned by a friend and three of us built it
               together at Hack the North.

- name: UW Course Alerter
  technologies: Python
  link:
  description: Sometimes when enrolling for courses, students cannot enroll in the section they wish, or not in the course
               at all. It is also slow to check Quest for availability, the registration system of the University of Waterloo.
               UW Courser Alerter is made to make registering for desired courses and sections easier.
               Currently, an API is available to check for course availability and send email notifications if the course or
               section is available and a sample cron client is made that calls this API regularly.

- name: Waterloo Region ION Survey
  technologies: Node.js with AngularJS
  description: "I worked with an Civil Engineering undergrad and a Civil Engineering Graduate student
               to create a single page web application to collect surveys on people's thoughts about the LRT project in the
               Kitchener-Waterloo region. I architected this web application, wrote more than 70% of the code, and maintain
               it on Heroku."
