              Hi, I'm Michael. My Chinese name is Zhucheng Tu (涂竹成).
              I'm a Research Engineer working on developing foundation models for recommendations, personalization, and search at Netflix since August 2024.
              Prior to that I was a Machine Learning Engineer in the AI/ML Information Intelligence org at Apple from January 2019 - August 2024, primarily working on open-domain question answering and search.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              I graduated as a thesis-based Master's student from the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science</a>
              at the <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> in 2018, specializing at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval.
              During my Master's my focus was on semantic textual similarity and retrieval-based question answering.
              I was advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/" target="_blank">Jimmy Lin</a>.
              I also completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo majoring in Software Engineering, graduating on the Dean's Honour's List in June 2017.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              I enjoy building things end-to-end, doing whatever is needed to get the job done, whether it is modeling, infrastructure, data, or anything in-between.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                My overarching goals have remained the same for many years: to be an earnest person
                whom can be relied upon and to never stop learning.
                I am interested in photography, travelling, skiing / snowboarding, reading, history, and astronomy.
