          <p>I am a third year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
            My overarching goals have remained the same for many years: to be simply a good, earnest person
            whom can be relied upon and to never stop learning.

          <p>On this website you can learn more about the projects I have been working on. Eventually I will also
            start blogging.</p>

          <p>Outside of school I enjoy reading, catching up on the latest world news,
            and exploring mind-blowing topics relevant to my field on Coursera and edX. Currently I am also
            learning photography and playing the guitar.</p>
