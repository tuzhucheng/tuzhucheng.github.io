            <p class="lead text-center">I am a fourth year undergrad at
                the University of Waterloo majoring in Software Engineering.
                I am interested in engineering software systems and working on analytics
                to extract insights from large amounts of data. In the past two years, I
                have done various internships focusing on these responsibilities at Facebook,
                Uber, and Reflektion. In addition, I am also experienced in building full-stack web applications.
            </p>

            <p class="lead text-center">
                My overarching goals have remained the same for many years: to be an earnest person
                whom can be relied upon and to never stop learning.
                I enjoy photography, travelling, reading, and expanding my technical breadth
                and depth by taking courses on Coursera and edX.
