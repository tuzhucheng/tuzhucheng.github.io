              I am a Master's student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo,
              specializing at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval, advised by
              Professor <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/" target="_blank">Jimmy Lin</a>. I also completed my undergrad at uWaterloo majoring in Software Engineering,
              graduating on the Dean's Honour's List in June 2017.

              My interest is in natural language processing / text, applied machine learning, and building the
              infrastructure to support these goals. During my undergrad, I have done various internships focusing on
              various aspects of these responsibilities at Facebook, Uber, and Reflektion. One of my main strengths
              is I am skilled in building end-to-end systems, from the data pipelines in the backend to the clients in the
              frontend.
            </p>

                My overarching goals have remained the same for many years: to be an earnest person
                whom can be relied upon and to never stop learning.
                I enjoy photography, travelling, reading, and expanding my technical breadth
                and depth by taking online courses.
