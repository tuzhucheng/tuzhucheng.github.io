              Hi, I'm Michael. My Chinese name is Zhucheng Tu (涂竹成).
              I'm a Research Engineer working on developing the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/foundation-model-for-personalized-recommendation-1a0bd8e02d39" target="_blank">foundation model for personalized recommendation</a> at Netflix since August 2024, serving 300M+ subscribers, where I am the lead IC for the PyTorch-based foundation model.
              Prior to that I was a Machine Learning Engineer in the AI/ML org at Apple from January 2019 - August 2024.
              For most of my time there (July 2020 - August 2024) I was a core engineer on open-domain question answering and search (O(100M) unique monthly devices).
              Since April 2022 I also had close collaborations with the Apple Foundation Models team, including executing the bulk of the technical engineering work (modeling + infra) to productionize one of the first models trained using the <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.05411" target="_blank">foundation model codebase</a>, for web ranking. 
              From January 2019 - June 2020 I had the opportunity to rotate on different teams including Visual Intelligence, AI Research, Machine Translation, Web Question Answering, Knowledge Graph Question Answering, and Differential Privacy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              I graduated as a thesis-based Master's student from the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science</a>
              at the <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> in 2018, specializing at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval.
              During my Master's my focus was on semantic textual similarity and retrieval-based question answering.
              I was advised by Professor <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/" target="_blank">Jimmy Lin</a>.
              I also completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo majoring in Software Engineering, graduating on the Dean's Honour's List in June 2017.
              During my undergrad I interned at large tech companies (Meta, Uber) as well as a Series B e-commerce start-up that powered the recommedation system of Uniqlo, Disney, etc. at the time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              I enjoy building things end-to-end, doing whatever is needed to get the job done, whether it is modeling, infrastructure, data, or anything in-between. I can wear multiple hats. Much of the work to build a successful product is not glamorous, after all.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                My overarching goals have remained the same for many years: to be an earnest person
                whom can be relied upon and to never stop learning.
                I am interested in photography, reading, travelling, skiing / snowboarding, history, and astronomy.
